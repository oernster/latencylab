# Runtime dependencies.
#
# NOTE: the LatencyLab *core engine* under `latencylab/` is stdlib-only.
# This file includes the optional UI runtime dependency so `pip install -r
# requirements.txt` is enough to run the GUI.
#
# Legacy v1 (NumPy-backed) execution remains optional. Install legacy support via
# requirements-dev.txt (for development/testing) or `pip install numpy`.
